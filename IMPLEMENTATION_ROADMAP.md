## 🏗️ Key Technical Components

### Multi-Currency Support
```typescript
// Core currency handling
export class Money {
  amount: number;
  currency: string; // ZAR, USD, EUR, etc.
  
  constructor(amount: number, currency: string = 'ZAR') {
    this.amount = amount;
    this.currency = currency;
  }
}

// Exchange rate service
export class ExchangeRateService {
  async getSARBRates(): Promise<ExchangeRate[]> {
    // South African Reserve Bank API integration
  }
  
  async convertAmount(amount: Money, toCurrency: string): Promise<Money> {
    // Real-time currency conversion
  }
}
```

### Smart Approval Engine
```typescript
export class SmartApprovalEngine {
  async determineApprovalPath(request: ApprovalRequest): Promise<ApprovalPath> {
    const amount = request.amount;
    const risk = await this.calculateRisk(request);
    
    if (amount < 5000 && risk === 'LOW') {
      return { autoApprove: true, approvers: [] };
    }
    
    // Single or multiple approvals based on amount/risk
  }
}
```

### BOM Integration (Non-Disruptive)
```typescript
export class BOMIntegrationService {
  async processBOMFile(file: File): Promise<BillOfMaterials> {
    // Support Excel, CSV, PDF formats
    // Smart parsing and validation
    // Automatic part number matching
  }
  
  async extractBOMFromCAD(cadFile: File): Promise<BillOfMaterials> {
    // SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Inventor integration
    // Preserve existing CAD workflows
  }
}
```
