## 📋 Approval Workflow Optimization

### Current vs Optimized Processes

#### Engineering Change Process
**Current (15-20 days)**:
```
Design → Review → Approval → Engineering Manager → VP → Final Approval
```

**Optimized (2-5 days)**:
```
Design → Parallel Review (Auto-approval if <R5k) → Single Approval → Complete
```

#### Purchase Order Process
**Current (5-10 days)**:
```
Request → Manager → Director → VP → Finance → Final Approval
```

**Optimized (1-3 days)**:
```
Request → Auto-approval (standard items) → Single Approval (custom items) → Complete
```

#### Production Order Process
**Current (3-5 days)**:
```
Order → Planning → Approval → Manufacturing → Release
```

**Optimized (Same day)**:
```
Order → Auto-release (standard products) → Single approval (custom work) → Complete
```
