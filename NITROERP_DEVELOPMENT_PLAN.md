## 📊 Multi-Currency Implementation Strategy

### Supported Currencies
- **Primary**: ZAR (South African Rand)
- **Major Trading**: USD, EUR, GBP
- **Regional**: JPY, CNY, AUD
- **Future**: Configurable currency additions

### Key Multi-Currency Features

#### 1. Exchange Rate Management
```typescript
// packages/services/financial/src/integrations/ExchangeRateService.ts
export class ExchangeRateService {
  async getSARBRates(): Promise<ExchangeRate[]> {
    // South African Reserve Bank API integration
    // Real-time ZAR exchange rates
    // Automatic daily rate updates
  }

  async getECBRates(): Promise<ExchangeRate[]> {
    // European Central Bank API
    // EUR-based currency pairs
    // Backup rate source
  }

  async getManualRates(): Promise<ExchangeRate[]> {
    // User-defined exchange rates
    // Override automatic rates when needed
    // Audit trail for manual rate changes
  }
}
```

#### 2. Multi-Currency Transactions
```typescript
// packages/services/financial/src/models/MultiCurrencyTransaction.ts
export class MultiCurrencyTransaction {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  description: string;
  lines: TransactionLine[];
  baseCurrencyTotal: Money; // Always in ZAR
  foreignCurrencyTotal?: Money; // Original currency if applicable
  exchangeRate?: ExchangeRate;
  exchangeGainLoss?: Money; // Calculated FX impact
}

export class Money {
  amount: number;
  currency: string; // ISO 4217 codes (ZAR, USD, EUR, etc.)
  
  constructor(amount: number, currency: string = 'ZAR') {
    this.amount = amount;
    this.currency = currency;
  }
}
```

#### 3. Currency Conversion Rules
```typescript
// packages/services/financial/src/services/CurrencyConversionService.ts
export class CurrencyConversionService {
  private conversionRules = {
    'ZAR': { precision: 2, roundingMode: 'HALF_UP' },
    'USD': { precision: 2, roundingMode: 'HALF_UP' },
    'EUR': { precision: 2, roundingMode: 'HALF_UP' },
    'JPY': { precision: 0, roundingMode: 'HALF_UP' }, // No decimals for Yen
    'GBP': { precision: 2, roundingMode: 'HALF_UP' }
  };

  async convertWithHistory(
    amount: Money, 
    toCurrency: string, 
    date: Date
  ): Promise<ConversionResult> {
    // Historical rate lookup for specific date
    // Proper rounding per currency rules
    // Audit trail of conversion calculation
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Optimized Workflow Implementation

### Current vs Optimized Workflows

#### Engineering Change Process
**Current (15-20 days)**:
```
Design → Review → Approval → Engineering Manager → VP → Final Approval
```

**Optimized (2-5 days)**:
```
Design → Parallel Review (Auto-approval if <$5K) → Single Approval → Complete
```

#### Purchase Order Process
**Current (5-10 days)**:
```
Request → Manager → Director → VP → Finance → Final Approval
```

**Optimized (1-3 days)**:
```
Request → Auto-approval (standard items) → Single Approval (custom items) → Complete
```

#### Production Order Process
**Current (3-5 days)**:
```
Order → Planning → Approval → Manufacturing → Release
```

**Optimized (Same day)**:
```
Order → Auto-release (standard products) → Single approval (custom work) → Complete
```

### Smart Approval Engine
```typescript
// packages/shared/src/workflow/SmartApprovalEngine.ts
export class SmartApprovalEngine {
  async determineApprovalPath(request: ApprovalRequest): Promise<ApprovalPath> {
    const amount = request.amount;
    const type = request.type;
    const risk = await this.calculateRisk(request);
    
    if (amount < 5000 && risk === 'LOW') {
      return { autoApprove: true, approvers: [] };
    }
    
    if (amount < 25000 && risk === 'MEDIUM') {
      return { autoApprove: false, approvers: [request.departmentManager] };
    }
    
    return { autoApprove: false, approvers: [request.departmentManager, request.vp] };
  }

  async calculateRisk(request: ApprovalRequest): Promise<RiskLevel> {
    // Analyze historical data
    // Check vendor reliability
    // Evaluate project complexity
    // Return risk assessment
  }
}
```
